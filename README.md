Minimal area enclosing triangle implementation
=====================

This project contains C++ implementations of brute-force cubic and linear time algorithms for computing the minimal area triangles enclosing a set of 2D points. Different tests were designed and implemented to verify the correctness of the linear time algorithm implementation.
